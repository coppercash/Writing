# Getting Addicted to an Anime 

These days, I am getting addicted to a Japanese anime.

It was about, in the future, a group of people collecting spaceflight debris in Earth orbit.

The whole work was perfect â€” It had a science-fiction background; the plot was attractive; the pictures were beautiful; even better, the story had a happy ending.

Even so, I felt sad after I finished the last episode of the series.

Because the story has ended, I can never know what will happen to the characters in the future.

It is like that I have lost some intimate friends forever.

I can't visit, call, or write to them. 

Any connection has been cut. 

No information about them can be received anymore. 

All that remains are the wonderful memories associated with them.

I understand what happened in the story was just a story. 

I have to get back to the real world no matter how real my feeling was.
