# Updated SIM Card

Last week, I updated my SIM card from 3G to 4G.

In China, a cell phone number is bound to a SIM card instead of directly to a phone,

and the SIM in your phone determines what kind of mobile network you can use.

This should have been a trifle which is not worth mentioning, except one thing interesting happened in the progress.

The employee of the carrier told me that my phone was 3G and would not work with a 4G SIM card in it.

I had already learned that from the internet before she told me. Beyond this, I also knew that it was because that the carrier didn't get the licences rather than technical issues with my phone.

Under my strong insistence, the worker reluctantly updated my card.

Now I can enjoy more internet with less cost.

Do not fully trust authorities, they don't care about your feelings like you do.
