# Update SIM card

Last week, I updated my SIM card from 3G to 4G.

In China, cell phone number is bound to SIM card instead of directly to phone,

and the SIM in your phone determines what kind of mobile network you can use.

This should have been a trifle which is not worth mentioning, except one thing interesting happened in the progress.

The worker of the carrier told me that my phone was of 3G and would not work with a 4G SIM card in it.

Before she told me, I had already known that from the Internet. Beyond this, I also acquired that it was because that the carrier didn't get the licences rather than technical issues with my phone.

Under my strong insistent, the worker updated my card reluctantly.

Now I can enjoy more traffic with less cost.

Do not fully trust authorities, they don't care about your feelings like yourself do.
