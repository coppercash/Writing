# Forgot Covering the Bill

Last Sunday, I went to a coffee bar to do some work because I couldn't concentrate in my own apartment.

It was a good bar because I need't pay before finishing the food I ordered. 

I believe a restaurant which is worth my coming once again should have the confidence to let its customer taste the food before spending money on it.

I was pretty efficient on my work that afternoon. I left the bar with satisfaction and headed towards another restaurant for dinner.

When I paid for my dinner, I thought this meal was so cheap that even the cup of coffee…wait, did I paid for my coffee?

Fortunately, I found the contract of the coffee bar online so that, instead of in the real world, I could send them the money on the Internet.
