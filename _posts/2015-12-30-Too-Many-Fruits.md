# Too Much Fruit

I don't know how it is like in other countries, Chinese companies usually provide their employees with some foods as presents on holidays.

This Christmas, my company dispensed fruits to everyone of us, two full cartons of fruit.

I counted. They were 12 apples and 18 oranges.

I admit that they are fresh and juicy. However, for a single person, who lives in an apartment alone without a refrigerator, that is too much fruit.

I hate wasting, so I have to eat it all up before it starts to spoil. 

But usually I wouldn't eat so much fruit because my stomach always objects to it.

Such a dilemma.
