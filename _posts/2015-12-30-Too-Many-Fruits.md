# Too Many Fruits

I don't know how it likes in other countries, Chinese companies usually provide their employees with some foods as presents on Holiday.

My company, this Christmas, dispensed fruits to everyone of us, two full cartons of fruits.

I counted. They were 12 apples and 18 oranges.

I admit that they are fresh and juicy. However, for a single person, who lives in an apartment alone without a refrigerator, they are too many.

I hate to waste, so I have to eat them up before they start to spoil. 

But usually I wouldn't eat too many fruits, because my stomach always objects to it.

Such a dilemma.
