# Goodbye Mr. Loser

I just watched a movie called "Goodbye Mr. Loser".

It is a wonderful movie, because as a comedy, it didn't just make me laugh, but also inspired me.

In this movie, the male protagonist gets married to the girl he grows up with, but he always regrets that he wasn't able to marry the most gorgeous girl in his high school. 

For some unknown reason, he travels back through time, and is able to start his life again as a high school student.

After years in his second life, he becomes a successful singing star and gets married to the school beauty. But he isn't happy, because he finally finds out in his deep heart that the girl who was always with him is his true love, though she is not as beautiful.

The story couldn't be any older, but there are still some points that deserve to be mentioned.

After the protagonist returns to his high school, he tells his best buddy to buy as many apartments as he can, because he is from the future and knows that the price of housing will rise crazily. 

His best buddy does what he says, but sells all his apartments when the price increases by 10%. But every Chinese person knows that the price has risen by a factor of 20 in the past 15 years. 

The guy just doesn't have what it takes. Even with the information brought back by someone from the future, he won't succeed
