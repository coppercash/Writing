# Tooth Extraction

Last week I had one of my teeth extracted. It was a wisdom tooth.

I had it done in a morning in order to go back to my duties at work.

But I was worried about if it would hurt too much so that I couldn't concentrate on my work.

Therefore, I waited at the hospital till noon, sitting on a bench.

It seemed my tooth wasn't going to give me a hard time, so I went to my office building.

However, at about 4 p.m. that day, the pain came.

I thought the dentist injected too much anesthetic.

According to what was written on the "Recovery Tips", the effect of anesthetic was supposed to disappear after 2 hours, but it took at least four hours for me.
