# Tooth Extracting

Last week, I had one of my teeth, which was a wisdom tooth, extracted.

I did it in a morning in order to go back to my duty in company.

But I worried about if it would hurt too much so that I couldn't concentrate on my work.

Therefore, I waited in a the hospital till noon, sitting on a bench.

It seemed my tooth wasn't going to give me a hard time, so I went to my company.

However, at about 4 p.m. that day, the pain came eventually.

I thought the dentist injected too much anesthetic.

According to what was written on the "Recovery Tips", the affection of anesthetic was supposed to disappear after 2 hours, but it took at least 4 hours on me.
