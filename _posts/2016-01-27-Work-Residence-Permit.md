# Work Residence Permit

My company recently started to help us handle work residence permits in Beijing.

This kind of permit is like work visa. But rather a country, they permit their owners to live in and enjoy welfare offered by a first tier city.

In the early years, big companies in Beijing would be popular because of their capacity to handle registered permanent residence (like green card). 

But these years, the opportunities to handle them are becoming more and more scarce, so a non-permanent residence is also attractive to most people.

Like any kinds of certificates or permits in China, to handle a work residence permit is incredibly complicated.

The most irritating part is that it requires me to prove my education background and degree with certificates issued by specified bureaus, ignoring the fact that I already have certificates from my college.

And each certificate they provide, which is simply a piece of paper, will cost me more than Â¥200 (roughly $40).

I believe I understand the necessity of these papers. Some employees of government are good at nothing but filing tables. The money I have been paying for all kinds of certificates must be used to feed them.
