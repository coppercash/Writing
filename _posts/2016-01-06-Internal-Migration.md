# Internal Migration

Someone says that the largest scale of animal migration isn't in Africa, but in China.

Because the core sense of Spring Festival is reunion with families, hundreds of millions of Chinese people go back to hometowns, neglecting how far they are, from first tier cities, and do it again in the contrary direction when the vacation ends.

Although economy is not bad in recent years, airplanes are not affordable to everyone. Thus, the majority will still choose train for long journey, and I am one of them.

Instead of simply buying, everyone needs to fight for the tickets because there are not enough trains for so many passengers that pop up during Spring Festival.

A person like me who is familiar with computers and the Internet may use a software to incessantly query the electronic ticketing system on the website to contend with other passengers.

This way can save me the trouble standing in a queue at night, but it doesn't turn out good every time.

Like this time, I got a ticket for a train which departs at 3 am. I don't have any experience or idea about how to get to the station before dawn.

Some of my friends recommended Uber, I will try it if I can't change my ticket with another one of daylight ultimately.
