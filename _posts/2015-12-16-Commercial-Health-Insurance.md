# Commercial Health Insurance

In my early diary, I said that I had one of my wisdom teeth extracted.

My company buys commercial health insurance for its employees,

so that I can get reimbursed for the money I spend in hospital.

This was the first time I applied for insurance claim.

The whole progress was quite convenient. However, unfamiliar with it, I was still retarded by some trifles.

Anyway, I handed in the form in the middle of last month.

Not any responses were there for a long time.

I had worried a lot about whether there were any details I missed until I finally got the money yesterday.

One of my workmate told me that, at this time of every month, the insurance company handled applications and sent out money.

Thus, it is not slow, but just has its fixed schedule.
