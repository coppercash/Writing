# Hiring Anniversary Celebration

By tomorrow, I will have been working for my company for a whole year.

I'd like to celebrate it by ordering a cake for my workmates to show appreciation their accompanying me for the last year.

However, I am currently hesitant.

Because I am not good at handling congratulation, the atmosphere would be awkward tomorrow.

Although I know that all I need to do is to say "thank you", I just can't utter the words.

I think that is because I am a perfectionist inside â€” I want everything to be perfect, even some simple appreciation words.

But I am doing it anyway, because perfectionism is so wrong and I am going to banish it out of my mind!
