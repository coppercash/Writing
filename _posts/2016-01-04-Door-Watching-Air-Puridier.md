# Open Door Detecting Air Purifier

I bought an air purifier because of the severe air pollution about a month ago.

Although working well for quite a while, it surprised me last Friday evening. 

After turned on for a few minutes, my purifier can always keep the index of fine particulate matter in my apartment under 20.

However, the index kept fluctuating around 50 that evening.

I turned up the blower to make things better, but it didn't turn out very well.

I got really annoyed, because I thought the purifier was worn out or something because of its poor quality.

Then I started to wonder if there was an unclosed window which could be an entrance for the polluted air. 

After I checked, it turned out to be my door that I forgot to close.

Fortunately, my purifier alerted me to it. It would have been very dangerous if I had left my door open all the night.
