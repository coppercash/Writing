# Door Watching Air Purifier

I bought myself an air purifier because of the severe air pollution about a month ago.

Although working well around me for quite a while, it surprised me on last Friday evening. 

After turned on for minutes, my purifier can always keep the index of fine particulate matter in my apartment under 20.

But in that evening, the index kept going up and down around 50.

I increased the wind volume to make things better, but it didn't turn out very well.

I got really annoyed, because I thought the purifier got worn or something because of its poor quality.

Then I started to wonder if there was an unclosed window which could be an entrance for the polluted air. 

After I checked, it turned to be my door that I forgot to close.

Fortunately, my purifier warned me about that. It would have been too dangerous if I had left my door open during the night.
