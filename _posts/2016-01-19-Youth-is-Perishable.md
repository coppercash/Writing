# Youth is Perishable

I bought an hourglass to help myself fight against procrastination.

Although being aware of that the time never stops passing, I still forget it sometimes until serveral hours have been wasted by me.

The hourglass has green sand in it, which stands for youth. And it is made of purely glass without any sort of frame, so it reminds me better how perishable it is.

Talking about treasuring time, its Chinese counterpart, which is "æƒœ", is very interesting. It consists of a heard, a segment of horizon and a sun. 

From the character pattern, we can tell that ancient Chinese feel sorry for the wasted time after the sun sinks below the horizon.

It seems that people have been resisting procrastination since my ancestors' age, and it didn't come to an end so far.

Just like my ancestors, I don't believe that I can beat my procrastination all at once. But I am sure that I will fight against it within the rest of my life.
