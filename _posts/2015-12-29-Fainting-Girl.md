# Fainting Girl

Sunday night, while reading something on the subway, I felt one of my feet hit suddenly.

When I looked down to figure out what it was, my spirit was almost scared out of my body.

I saw a girl's face â€” she fell unconscious and lied there without any movement.

People around her started to discuss how to help her.

Because of some stupid judgments made before, in which the heroes were responsible to pay the medical fee for the persons they saved, less and less people dare to help strangers in China.

I decided to call the police, because I saw her twitched once or twice. It would be too dangerous if the girl was attacked by epilepsy.

Fortunately, she woke up by herself. 

A madam asked if she had anaemia, and got the positive answer. Perhaps due to the madam's own experience, she offered some chocolate to the girl.

Not until this moment did I notice the girl was as thin as a skeleton.

In the end, the girl called her family and left the subway at the very next stop.

After a while, I felt luck for the girl. Although my shoe was not a comfortable pillow, to hit it was still much better than directly hit the floor.

Anyway, wish her good health in the future.
