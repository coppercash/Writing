# Fainting Girl

Sunday night, while reading something on the subway, I felt something hit one of my feet suddenly.

When I looked down to figure out what it was, my spirit was almost scared out of my body.

I saw a girl's face â€” she fell unconscious and lay there without any movement.

People around her started to discuss how to help her.

Because of some stupid judgments made before, in which the heroes were responsible to pay the medical fee for the persons they saved, less and less people dare to help strangers in China.

I decided to call the police, because I saw her twitch once or twice. It would be too dangerous if the girl had had an epilepsy attack.

Fortunately, she woke up by herself. 

A woman asked if she had anemia, and got a positive answer. Perhaps due to the woman's own experience, she offered some chocolate to the girl.

Not until this moment did I notice the girl was as thin as a skeleton.

In the end, the girl called her family and left the subway at the very next stop.

After a while, I felt that the girl was luckey. Although my shoe was not a comfortable pillow, to hit it was still much better than directly hitting the floor.

Anyway, I wish her good health in the future.
