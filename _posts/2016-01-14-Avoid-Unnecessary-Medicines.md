# Avoid Unnecessary Medicines

I have a bad cold. I can't help but cough. 

If I remember correctly, it has been years since the last time I kept coughing like a machine gun.

I barely catch a cold. Even if I do, I will recover in a very short time.

It is credited to that instead of taking cold medicines, I wait for my body to recover itself.

I heard that one's immunity will decline if he takes medicine too frequently. 

A real life example would be one of my college roommates, who always took a lot of piles immediately after catching a cold. 

Ignoring my suggesting him not to take so much, he believed in the fact that medicines would help him recover faster.

Perhaps that was true, but it was so easy for him to catch a cold that the medicines he had taken were even likely to be more than what I will take for my entire life.

An exception to me is fever. Having a fever would cause permanent damage to one's brain or other organs on his head, which is horrible.
