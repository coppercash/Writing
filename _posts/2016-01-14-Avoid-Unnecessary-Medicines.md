# Avoid Unnecessary Medicines

I have a bad cold. I have been coughing uncontrollably. 

If I remember correctly, it has been years since the last time I kept coughing like a machine gun.

I hardly ever catch a cold. Even if I do, I recover in a very short time.

I credit that to the fact that instead of taking cold medicines, I wait for my body to recover by itself.

I heard that one's immunity declines if they take medicine too frequently. 

A real life example would be one of my college roommates, who always took a lot of pills immediately after catching a cold. 

Ignoring my suggesting him not to take so much, he believed in the fact that medicine would help him recover faster.

Perhaps that was true, but it was so easy for him to catch a cold that the medicines he had taken were likely to be more than what I will take for my entire life.

An exception to me is fever. Having a fever would cause permanent damage to one's brain or other organs on their head, which is horrible.
