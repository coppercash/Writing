# Frightening Skiing

Have you ever been stuck on ski lift alone in the dark night? I do.

I went skiing with my friends last Saturday. Because of the lower price, we went there at night.

Before the accident happened, I was taking the lift to the mountainside so that I could ski down along the intermediate track later.

My only company was a guy working there. I could tell because he was in a suit with the name of the ski resort on it.

Having to sit on there for a long time, we started chatting. During the conversation, I was told to put my ski sticks above on the seat instead of holding it.

I followed what he said, but it resulted my ski sticks and I being stuck by the handrail by the time I was supposed to left.

The employer who was responsible for the lift stopped it for the emergency. However it was too late â€” carried by the lift, I had already been too high from the ground.

I had no choice but to go to the mountaintop and then return from there, because the lift couldn't run the opposite direction.

In the night, the senior track, which started from the mountaintop, was actually closed. Thus, I took a very long journey with no body but the cold wind and the creak caused by the lift.

It was pretty scary to be alone in the dark night on the mountain. However, considering it was a rare experience, I still took several photos with my shaking hands.
