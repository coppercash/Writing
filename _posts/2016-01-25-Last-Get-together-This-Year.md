# Last Get-together This Year

In order to practice oral English, I and my friends have been holding a discussion group every weekend for more than a year.

Because most of them are leaving Beijing for each's hometwon to spend the Spring Festival with their families, yesterday, we got together for the last time this Chinese year.

We spent a lot of precious time, and our English has been improving gradually.

But it is always hard to measure how much progress I have made.

I believe this is one of the reasons that why working hard, no matter on what, takes so much persistence.

Because on the track to my terminal point, which is to master speaking English, I know neither how long I have finished nor it is still remained.

I can't even describe my target clearly. All I can do is to head towards a vague direction.

Fortunately, I am not lonely on my journey. I have my fellas who can remind me how wonderful it will be if I achieve my goal so that I have not yet given up.

Thanks for your companion, my friends. May us make more progress in the coming year!
