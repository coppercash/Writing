# Last Get-Together This Year

In order to practice oral English, my friends and I have been holding a discussion group every weekend for more than a year.

Because most of them are leaving Beijing for their respective hometwons to spend the Spring Festival with their families, yesterday we got together for the last time this Chinese year.

We have spent a lot of precious time together, and our English has been improving gradually.

But it is always hard to measure how much progress I have made.

I believe this is one of the reasons why working hard, no matter on what, takes so much persistence.

Because on the track to my terminal point, which is to master speaking English, I know neither how much I have finished nor what is still remained.

I can't even describe my target clearly. All I can do is to head in a vague direction.

Fortunately, I am not alone on my journey. I have my fellas who can remind me how wonderful it will be if I achieve my goal, so I have not given up yet.

Thanks for your companionship, my friends. May we make more progress in the coming year!
