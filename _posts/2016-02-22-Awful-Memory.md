# Awful Memory

Forgetting the keys, I couldn't enter my apartment on the first evening I returned to Beijing from my hometown.

On the bright side, my landlord lives just one floor below my apartment, so I didn't have to look for a hotel for the night.

However, a similar situation had just happened a week before I left for home.

Although knowing that I had to call him for help, I hesitated for a long time. 

For some unknown reason, I am subconsciously incredibly reluctant to bother others.

In the end, my landlord heartily helped me open the door as he had done several times before.

This is just one more time my awful memory has caused an embarrassing situation.
