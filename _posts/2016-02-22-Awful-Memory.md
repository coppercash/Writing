# Awful Memory

Forgetting the keys, I could't enter my apartment in the first evening I returned to Beijing from my hometown.

On the bright side, my landlord lives just one floor below my apartment, so I didn't have to find a hotel for that night.

However, a similar situtaion just had happened one week before I left for home.

Although knowing that I had to call him for help, I hesitated for a long time. 

Without knowing the reason, I am incredibly reluctant to bother others in my subconcious.

In the end, my landload heartily helped me open the door as he did for several times.

My awful memory just humaliated me one more time.
