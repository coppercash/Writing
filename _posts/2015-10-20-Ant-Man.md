# Ant Man

Today is Tuesday. At today of every week, my company offers us movie tickets.

My workmates have gone to watch the movie called "Ant Man", but I didn't go with them because I am not interested in movies of this category.

I used to enjoy movies which shot by Marvel very much, and go to movie theatre for every one of them.

However, I don't have such strong enthusiasm anymore.

Handsome man, beautiful girls and exciting pictures -- there they are still in the movies, it's just the similar stories never attract me like before.
