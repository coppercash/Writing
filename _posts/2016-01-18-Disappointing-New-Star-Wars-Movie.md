# Disappointing New Star Wars Movie

I watched the new movie called The Force Awakens, and found that I did't enjoy it as I expected.

Perhaps that is because before the movie, I heard the box office had surpassed how much Avatar had made, but the movie didn't match my raised expectation.

In my opinion, this movie is only for the fans of the series.

The story is old â€” protagonist is born and grows up as nobody, but because of their mysterious family, they can master unbelievable power with little effort.

And the twist relationship between the father and his son, which involves both love and hate, is not something new either. I could even predict the son was about to murder his father before he actually did it.

As a big fan of Harry Potter, I can imagine if there is a new movie of the series published, I will be excited anyway neglecting whether the story is interesting or not.

However, I had never seen any other works of Star Wars, so I couldn't be moved by something like old friends' reunion.

I heard that the whole series has a huge amount of fans, and its position in film history is pretty special. Thus, I believe if finishing all the other movies of the series, I will become a fan. 

However I just can't make the decision. After all, there are six before the one I have watched.
