# Lossing Memories

After we finished skiing last Saturday, one of my friend's workmates lost part of his memories, or at least it was what he claimed. 

He said that his head knocked on something that he could not remember. 

Worse yet, he had two friends who didn't come but planned to leave with us, but he forgot who they were, so that we couldn't call them for leaving.

At first, I worried about him as all my friends did, but then I started suspecting that he was just pretending.

We tried taking him to the hospital for checking on whether his head got physically injured, but he objected to that strongly.

Even more suspicious, he kept asking questions like what day it was and with whom he came to the resort. Rather than being unable to remember these, it was more like that he was convincing us of his illness.

Anyway we sent him into a CT scanner that very night, and then the doctor told us he was OK.

Actually, I couldn't understand this man's behaviour. Obviously, he was not pretending losing memory for defraudation. Perhaps he just wanted some concerns. 

But I wonder whether he considered the result that he discretionarily consumed others' friendship and kindness.
