# Dense Fog

When I was in my hometown during the National Day holiday, I drove into a heavy fog on my way back from my cousin's wedding.

It rolled over us in a flash, just like in a science fiction movie. Suddenly we ran into a pall of white and couldn't see anything except the painted lines on the road in front of the car hood.

I slowed down to a little faster than stop and turned on the turn flashers to signal the emergency. Gradually I could see other patches of yellow flashing around us.

It was such a long journey in the fog (or at least I felt like it was). If I stared at the fog, I would have illusion driving in some sort of liquid because it seemed to flow and swirl around us..

I even ran a red light. I swear I saw it, but under such high tensions, I forgot that I needed to stop.
