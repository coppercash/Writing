# Dense Fog

When I was in my hometown during the National Day holiday, I drove into a heavy frog on my way back from my cousin's wedding.

It happened in a flash, just like in a science fiction movie. Suddenly we ran into a pall of white and couldn't see anything except the very next segment of road line ahead of us.

I slowed the speed down to a little faster than stop and turned on the emergency lights. Gradually I could see other patches of yellow flash around us.

It was such a long journal in the frog (or at least I felt it was). If I stare at the frog, I would have illusion in which I was driving in some sort of liquid because ii did flow.

I even ran a red light. I swear I saw it. I just forgot that I need to stop under such high tensions.
