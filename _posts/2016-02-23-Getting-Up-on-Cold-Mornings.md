# Getting Up on Cold Mornings

It is very hard for me to get up on cold winter mornings.

Therefore, before getting out of bed I text my friends, which helps me get motivated to get up.

However, these days, I find myself wanting to fall back asleep even after sending out my greeting.

I have been trying out many different methods to fight my relunctance for getting up early.

Most of them worked perfectly at first, but gradually became noneffective just as the morning texting did.

I've heard it said that having trouble with getting up means that one is lacking passion for life.

I can't tell whether that is true. Perhaps, I need to find it out for myself.
