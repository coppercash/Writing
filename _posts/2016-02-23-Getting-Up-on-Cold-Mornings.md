# Getting Up on Cold Mornings

It is very hard for me to get up on cold winter mornings.

Thus, I greet my friends in a mobile application to gain more motivation from their supervision.

However, these days, I found myself could fell asleep again after sending out my greeting.

I have been trying many methods to fight against my relunctance on getting up early.

Most of them worked perfectly at first, but gradually became noneffective just as the morning-greeting did.

Someone says that having trouble with getting up means one's lacking of passion for life.

I can't tell whether it is true. Perhaps, I need to find it myself.
