# Public Housing Accumulation Fund

In China , all employees save a part of their salary into this fund every month. 

Years ago, you could only withdraw these money for buying your own apartment.

Then the management department loosed their requirements, which results in your be able to use the money for renting house with showing renting agreement and invoice.

In June this year, the requirements was loosed again. Now, you can get money, of which the amount is limited, without any sorts of proof but only your ID card and bank card.

This should have been (and I believe it still is) a good thing. However, when getting the office yesterday, I was told that they had updated the requirements by adding new form to be handed. 

I argued the table was not claimed on their website, and was told "The website you viewed has not been updated yet."
