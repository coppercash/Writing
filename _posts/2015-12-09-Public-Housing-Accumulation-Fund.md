# Public Housing Accumulation Fund

In China , all employees save a part of their salary in this fund every month. 

Years ago, you could only withdraw this money for buying your own housing.

Then, the management department relaxed its requirements, which resulted in your being able to use the money for renting housing as long as presenting a rental agreement and an invoce.

In June of this year, the requirements were relaxed again. Now, you can withdraw a limited amount of money without any sort of proof besides your ID card and bank card.

This should have been and I believe it still is a good thing. However, when arriving the office yesterday, I was told that they had updated the requirements again by adding a new form to be submitted. 

I argued that the form was not required on their website, and I was told, "The website you viewed has not been updated yet."
