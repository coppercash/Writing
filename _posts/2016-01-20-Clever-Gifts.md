# Clever Gifts

Each day brings us closer to the Spring Festival.

At every significant traditional holiday, our company presents us with some kind of gift.

Yesterday they dispensed our gifts to us, which consisted of a vacuum cup, a bolster and several bags of nuts. The interesting thing is that we also had trolley luggages as packagings for all the other things.

The Spring Festival vacation always involves a lot of travel, during which a trolley luggage is pratical and convenient. Moreover, without it, it would be troublesome for us to bring the other gifts back home. 

Like last time, we received two cartons of fruit as gifts. They were pretty heavy, so if someone lived far away, they'd better have a friend to assist them in bringing that fruit home.

Although I don't know whose idea this is, I appreciate them for taking the time to prepare these gifts.
