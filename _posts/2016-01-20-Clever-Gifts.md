# Clever Gifts

Day by day, it is getting closer to the Spring Festival.

Every time for such significant traditional holidays, our company presents us with something as gifts.

Yesterday they had our gifts dispensed to us, which consists of a vacuum cup, a bolster and several bags of nuts. The interesting thing is that we also have draw-bar boxes as packaging for all the other things.

The Spring Festival vacation always involves a lot of travel, during which a draw-bar box is necessary and convenient. Moreover, without it, it will be a trouble for us to bring the other goods back home. 

Like last time, we had two cartons of fruit as gifts. They were pretty heavy, so if someone lived far, they'd better have a friend as assistance to bring that fruit home.

Although I don't know whose idea is this, I appreciate these thoughts for their preparing the gifts.
