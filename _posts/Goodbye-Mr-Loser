Just watched a movie called "Goodbye Mr. Loser".

It is a wonderful movie, because as a comedy, it didn't just make me laugh, but also inspired me.

In this movie, the male protagonist gets married with the girl he grows up with, but he always takes it a pity that he couldn't get married with the most gorgeous girl in his high school. 

With some unknown reason, he travels back through the time, and is able to start his life again as a high school student.

After years in his second life, he becomes a successful singing star and gets married with the school beauty. But he isn't happy, because finally he finds out in his deep heart the girl who was always with him is his true love, though she is not that beautiful.

The story can't be any older, but there are still some points deserve to be mentioned.

After the protagonist returns to his high school, he tells his best buddy to buy as many apartments as he can. Because he is from the future knowing the price of house will rise crazily. 

His best buddy does what he says and sells all his apartments when the price increases by 10%. But every Chinese knows that the price rises by 20 times in the past 15 years. 

The guy just doesn't have the things in him, even thought with the information carried back by someone from the future, he won't make it.
