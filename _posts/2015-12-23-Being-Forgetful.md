# Being Forgetful

I always left something behind me when heading out the door.

Sometimes, it was my mobile, or my wallet. Sometimes, it was the heater I forgot to turn off.

Once, I wanted to see the dentist for checking up on one of my teeth which kept hurting me.

I forgot to take my social insurance card with me. When I noticed that, I had already been 3 stations away from my apartment.

Although I got so upset about my own foolishness that I didn’t want move even one step, I had to take the subway right back to my apartment and start to run to everywhere, or I would be late for work.

I swore I wouldn’t let such things happen one more time.

I stuck an eye-catching tip on my door, so it could remind me to think twice of whether there was something I forgot to put in my pocket before I got outdoor.

It worked well at first. But I got used to it gradually, and even sometimes ignored it.

Yesterday, I left my mobile behind, damn, again.
