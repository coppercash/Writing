# Being Forgetful

I always leave something behind when heading out the door.

Sometimes, it is my cell phone, or my wallet. Sometimes, it is the heater I forgot to turn off.

Once, I wanted to see the dentist for a check-up on one of my teeth which kept hurting me.

I forgot to take my social insurance card with me. When I noticed that, I had already gone three stations away from my apartment.

Although I got so upset about my own foolishness that I didn’t want move even one step, I had to take the subway right back to my apartment and start running to everywhere, or I would be late for work.

I swore I wouldn’t let such things happen one more time.

I stuck an eye-catching reminder on my door, so it could remind me to think twice about whether there was something I forgot to put in my pocket before I went outdoors.

It worked well at first, but I got used to it gradually, and even sometimes ignored it.

Yesterday, I left my cell phone behind again, dammit.
