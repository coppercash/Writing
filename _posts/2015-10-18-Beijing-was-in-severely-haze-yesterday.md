Beijing was in severely haze yesterday.

I stayed my whole morning indoors to avoid breathing the dirty air.

However, I got out with my face mask in the afternoon because locking myself indoors with all the windows closed made it hard to breath too.

I prayed for clean air last night before my going to bed, and this morning I found that it worked!
