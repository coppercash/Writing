I made a mistake today.

While I was programming in the daytime, I encountered a conundrum which I had solved before.

I could have solved it easily as I used to do many times before.

But I chose to do it with a new method. 

After trying for 3 hours, I failed in the end, which results in that I had to work overtime to finish the tasks that needed to be done within today.

I am not saying that it is a bad thing to have the courage to put the knowledge which I newly learned into practice.

I just think it would have been much better if I had finished the rest of my tasks before I challenged the most difficult one.
