# Biting Cold

These days are really cold. I donâ€™t really feel cold outside, because I walk to most places, and the movement provides extra heat.

I currently live in an apartment at the top of the building, so two of the walls and the ceiling are exposed to the cold air outside, which results in a difficulty for the heat to accumulate.

According to a digital thermometer integrated into my alarm clock, the temperature is only twelve degrees.

Every morning when I am about to head out the door, I feel the resistance when trying to open it. I believe it freezes a little bit during the night.

Worse yet, getting up has never been so difficult, which shortens the morning that is already rushed.

Sometimes I wish the heating radiator could be hotter. However, on the other hand, I realise that higher temperatures require burning more coal, which would make the polluted air even worse.

Perhaps I should look for a new apartment, but apparently it is much more complicated than simply moving out of the current one. So I guess all I can do is to wait for the spring to come.
