# Bitting Cold

These days are really cold. I donâ€™t really feel cold outside, because I walk to most places, and movement provides extra heat.

I currently live in an apartment on the top of the building, so two of the walls and the ceiling are exposed to the cold air outside, which results in that it is very hard for the heat to accumulate.

According to a digital thermometer integrated in my alarm clock, the temperature is only twelve degree.

Every morning when I am about to head out the door, I feel the resistance back from it. I believe it is frozen a little bit during the night.

Worse yet, getting up has never been so difficult, which shortens the morning that is already in a hasty.

Sometimes I wish the heating radiator could be hotter. However, on the other hand, I realise that higher temperature requires burning more coal, which would make the polluted air even worse.

Perhaps I should look for a new apartment, but apparently it is much more complicated than simply moving out the current one. So I guess all I can do is to wait for the spring to come.
