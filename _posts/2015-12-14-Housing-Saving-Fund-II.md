# Housing Saving Fund II

After 2 days of waiting, I finally got the form, the lack of which was the reason I failed to apply for withdrawing my money from the fund.

I believed I had got every application material and could get my money soon, but it turned out that I was naive.

The center government did send out some sort of decree to simplify the application process. But the competent department of the fund has its means to oppose it on the sly.

It forbids you from applying individually, instead of which you need to apply as an employee of your company. However, a company is limited to apply for 5 persons per day.

I asked how long I have to wait, and was told "at least 6 months".
