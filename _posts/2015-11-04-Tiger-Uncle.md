# Tiger Uncle

Once I saw a man teaching his nephew how to swim in a swimming pool.

The little boy was crying all the time, because this man taught him in a very stern way, always said something like "Stop crying!" or "You just can't remember what I told you, can you?"

Although the kid improved a lot before his leaving, I guess he will never take a fancy to swimming, because in his memory, this sport will always be associated with fear and tears.

Compared with whether his nephew is happy or not, maybe to make the little boy learn is the only thing that man cares about.
