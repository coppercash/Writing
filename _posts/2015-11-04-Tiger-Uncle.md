# Tiger Uncle

Once I saw a man teaching his nephew how to swim in a swimming pool.

The little boy was crying all the time, because this man taught in a very stern way, always said something like "Shut your crying!" or "You just can't remember what I told you, can you?"

Although the kid improved a lot before his leaving, I guess he will never take a fancy to swimming, because in his memory, this sport will always be with fear and tears.

Compared with if his nephew is happy or not, maybe only to make him learn is what that man cares about.
