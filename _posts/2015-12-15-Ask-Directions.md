# Ask Directions

Yesterday, heading towards my office building, I was asked for directions by a foreign man in a subway station.

He had trouble to choose an escalator to get down to the right platform.

In Beijing most subway stations have 2 floors.

On basement one you buy tickets, go through turnstiles, or transfer from on line to another, and the platforms are on basement two.

I guess in this guyâ€™s mind, different escalators would lead him to trains towards different directions.

And what I mainly did was explaining that both escalators led to a same platform, and on the left side of it, the train heads towards the north, on the right, it was the contrary.

So, instead of the right escalator, it was the right side of the platform he needed to choose.

My oral English is limited, and scarcely having chances to speak to a native speaker, I was a little nervous, so that I failed to make it clear and had no choice but to lead him to a train myself.
