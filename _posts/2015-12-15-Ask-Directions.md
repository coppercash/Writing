# Ask Directions

Yesterday, while I was heading towards my office building, a foreign man in a the subway station asked me for directions.

He had trouble choosing an escalator to get down to the right platform.

In Beijing, most subway stations have two floors.

You buy tickets, go through turnstiles, or transfer from one line to another on basement one, and the platforms are on basement two.

I guess in this guyâ€™s mind, different escalators would lead him to trains traveling in different directions.

What I mainly did was explain to him that both escalators led to the same platform, and on the left side of it, the train heads towards the north, while on the right, it was the opposite.

So, instead of the right escalator, it was the right side of the platform he needed to choose.

My oral English is limited, and scarcely having chances to speak to a native speaker, I was a little nervous. In the end, I failed to make myself clear and had no choice but to lead him to a train myself.
