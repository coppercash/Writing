# Double 11

Tomorrow is November 11th, which is a holiday for single persons in China.

Although it is not a traditional holiday, we celebrate our being single on it because all the numbers form the date are "1", which stands for single.

In recent years, because of the advertisements from electronic business companies, the way to celebrate has changed to buy tremendous amount of things on websites.

However, although the price will decrease indeed, I can't think of a thing to buy.
