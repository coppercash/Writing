# Double 11

Tomorrow is November 11th, which is a holiday for single people in China.

Although it is not a traditional holiday, we celebrate our being single on this day because all the numbers in the date are "1", which stands for being single.

In recent years, because of the advertisements from online businesses, the way to celebrate has changed into buying tremendous amount of things on websites.

However, although the prices will indeed be lower, I can't think of anything to buy.
