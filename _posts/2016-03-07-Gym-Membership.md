# Gym Membership

Last Saturday, I went to a gym nearby my apartment and arranged for a membership card.

When walking through the playground with my brand new card, I was a little disappointed.

That was because around a fifth of the equipments were under repair.

However, since there is no other gym around, feeling regret won't be helpful either.

A big comfort is that the atmosphere there was good â€” everyone focused so much on doing exercise

A friend of mine can't understand why I'd spend time in gym which is such a boring place to him.

I guess he have never walked in to a gym and see the people there doing exercise in their sweat soaked clothes and their faces twisting because of the pain from their muscles.

Obviously, exercising is not something enjoyable, but with such strong desire to make themselves a better person, they work so hard.

And such kind of desire do I have.
