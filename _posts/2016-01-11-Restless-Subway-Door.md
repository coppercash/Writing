# Restless Subway Door

Yesterday I took the subway home. I do so everyday, so nothing surprising could have been expected.

After I got on the train and waited for it to depart, the door, which had already closed, opened again.

Such thing happens sometimes, which usually means someone's bag clamped between the two parts of a door. The door is supposed to reopen once, so that the passenger can get back his bag.

However the door reopened more than once yesterday. I stood there watching the door open and close for several times until a man in uniform scrambled through the broken door.

At first, he tried to force the door to keep closed with his bare hands, which was obviously impossible. I guessed he just lost his mind because of worrying about the next train was about to arrive.

Then he fiddled with the control box above the door which he opened with a wrench, and the door finally knew its place.

Anyway, the train departed as it had done for thousands of times, except one of its doors was sealed off with a yellow cation.
