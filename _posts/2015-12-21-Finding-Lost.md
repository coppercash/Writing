# Finding Lost

My company organised us to ski on last weekend.

This was the second time I went skiing. I believe I made a log of progress, because I didnâ€™t tumble too much as the first time.

For a newbie, a common mistake would be that seeing the world covered by snow, you would wear a lot to resist cold.

However, after skiing for a while, you would start sweating, and your gloves and scarf would be big burdens.

Obviously, this was what happened on me. On the cable car, I took off my gloves to make myself feel cooler.

Unfortunately, one of my gloves dropped down to the ground. I had to climb up and down the slope on foot to take it back.

It was exhausting, but I still feel lucky for finding it back in the end, because I was afraid that the one left would feel lonely.
