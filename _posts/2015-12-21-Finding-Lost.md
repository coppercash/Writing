# Finding the Lost One

My company organized a ski trip for us on last weekend.

This was the second time I went skiing. I believe I made a lot of progress, because I didnâ€™t tumble as much as the first time.

For a newbie, a common mistake would be when seeing the world covered in snow, they wear a lot to resist the cold.

However, after skiing for a while, they would start sweating, and your gloves and scarf would be a big burden.

Obviously, this was what happened on me. On the ski lift, I took off my gloves to cool off.

Unfortunately, one of my gloves fell on high to the ground. I had to climb up and down the slope on foot to get it back.

It was exhausting, but I still feel lucky for finding it back, because I was afraid that the one left would feel lonely.
