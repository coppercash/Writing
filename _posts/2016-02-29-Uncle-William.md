# Uncle William

I am the William, and I am becoming an uncle.

Actually, this is the fourth time for me to be someone's uncle.

Although I already have had three nephews, who are children of my three different cousins, I feel a little different this time.

That is because my relationship with my currently pregnant cousin is much more close than those with my other cousins â€” we sort of grew up together.

I remember the time of our childhood as if it was yesterday.

However, I attended her wedding three months ago, and last week I heard the news of her becoming a mother.

Time does fly.
