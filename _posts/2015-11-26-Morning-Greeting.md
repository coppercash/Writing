# Moring Greeting

I say good morning to my friends in an SNS group everyday.

It is much easier for me to have an early start with this behaviour.

I had my alarm to wake me up. But this morning I woke up myself.

So I said "AFTER days of getting up at the same time, I feel my body clock has been trained".

Afterwards I remembered, in my grammar book, it says perfect tense can't be used with AFTER.

However, I really wanted to express that my body clock had ALREADY been trained.

What is the proper expression?
