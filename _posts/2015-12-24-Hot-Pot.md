# Hot Pot

Our company offered us a big meal, which was served at a highly rated hot pot restaurant.

Hot pot is a very common cooking method in China, but the style is quite different from one place to another.

The style in which this restaurant handled the ingredients was very distinctive, which originates from Chongqing.

When people in Chongqing eat hot pot, the ingredients need to be very fresh, and they use a lot of spices and beef tallow to flavour them.

It is sort of unhealthy, but incredibly tasty.

Eating hot pot is a process that costs a lot of time. It is because the ingredients are raw when brought on, you need to boil them in the pot until they can be eaten.

During the meal, the water boils the whole time, and the moisture with the smell fills the entire room. Every article of your clothing will smell of the meal after you finish it.

Coming from food, the smell really stirs the appetite. But if it comes from your clothes, believe me, things will be totally different.

You need to wash your clothes when you get back home, or the smell will last for days.

Hot pot is the kind of food you either love or hate.
