# Hot Pot

Our company offered us a big meal, which was served at a highly rated hot pot restaurant.

Hot pot is a very common cooking method in China, but the style is quite different from one place to another.

This time, the way of the restaurant handled the ingredients was very distinctive, which originates from Chong Qing.

When people in Chong Qing eat hot pot, the ingredients need to be very fresh, and they use a lot of spices and beef tallow to flavour them.

It is sort of unhealthy, but incredibly tasty.

Eating hot pot is a process that costs a lot of time, because the ingredients are raw when brought on. You need to heat them in the pot until they can be eaten.

During the meal, the water will be boiling the whole time, and the moisture with the smell will fill the whole room. Every article of your clothing will smell of the meal after you finish the it.

The smell would stimulate people's appetite. But if it gets on your clothes, believe me, things will be totally different.

You will need to wash your clothes when you get back home, or the smell will last for days.

Hot pot is the kind of food you will either you love or hate.
