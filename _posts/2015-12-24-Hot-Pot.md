# Hot Pot

Our company offered us a big meal, which was served at a high rated hot pot restaurant.

Hot pot is a very common cooking method in China, but the style is quite different from one place to another.

This time, the way of the restaurant to handle the ingredients was very distinctive, which originates from Chong Qing.

When Chong Qing people eat hot pot, the ingredients need to be very refresh, and they will use a lot of spices and beef tallow to flavour them.

It is a sort of unhealthy, but incredibly tasty.

Eating hot pot is a process costs a lot of time, because the ingredients are raw when bring on, you need to heat them in the pot until them can be eaten.

During the meal, the water will be boiling all the time, and the moisture with the smell will fill the whole room. Every piece of your clothes will be flavoured after you finish the meal.

The smell is a very appetite-stirring if from food. But if it comes from your clothes, believe me, things will be totally different.

You need to change your clothes when you get back home, or the smell will last for days.

Hot pot is just such kind of food you either you love or hate.
