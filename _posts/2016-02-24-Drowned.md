# Drowned

One of my friends said on WeChat (Chinese Facebook) that a member of their winter swimming group drowned.

I was very shocked at first, but then I remembered an ancient saying, "People dying from falling off horses are mostly good riders".

The drowned women paid for her habit with her life, is that worthy?

Considering most of the rivers in Beijing are polluted, I can't imagine in which way people can enjoy swimming in them.

But still, I hope that she would have derived enough pleasure from swimming, because the price was too expensive.
