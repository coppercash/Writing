# Drowned

One of my friends said on WeChat (Chinese Facebook) that a member of their winter swimming group drowned.

I was very shocked at first, but then I remembered an ancient saying, "People dying from falling off horses are mostly good riders".

The drowned women paid for her hobby with her life, was it worth it?

Considering most of the rivers in Beijing are polluted, I can't imagine why people enjoy swimming in them.

Nevertheless, I hope that she derived enough pleasure from swimming, because the price was far too expensive.
