# High-Technology at McDonald's

It is always annoying to queue up in front of counters at McDonald's, especially when it is rush hour.

Fortunately, things are looking up.

Last time I went to the McDonald's, I saw four pillars standing near the entrance. On each of them, there were two screens hung back to back.

An advantage of being a programmer is that I don't need instructions to know how to use electronic devices.

After I selected on the screen what I wanted to eat and whether I would like it here or to go, a QR code showed up on it. 

I scanned the QR code with WeChat (a cell phone app that integrates a function much like Paypal), and then got a piece of paper with a serial number on it.

Only a few minutes later, my serial number appeared on another screen above the counter, which meant my meal was ready.

The whole process was just cool!
