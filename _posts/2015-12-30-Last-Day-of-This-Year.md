# Last Day of This Year

Today is the last day of this year. 

I have been studying English with my spare time since two years ago.

My target is to be capable to talk with native speakers frequently and read English efficiently enough.

I seems I haven't achieved my goal so far, which makes me pretty upset.

I tried to memorise a book of vocabulary, but finally forgot most of them.

I finished reading two grammar books, but it turned out that there is a gap between knowing the grammar acknowledge and mastering it.

I am not trying to say that I made no progress. 

My English has been obviously improved compared with two years ago.

I just hope it won't take too long before I reach the certain level.

Anyway, wish myself and all my friends good luck to realise each's goal in the coming year.
