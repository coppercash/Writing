# Last Day of This Year

Today is the last day of this year. 

I have been studying English with my spare time for the last two years.

My target is to be able to talk with native speakers fluently and read English efficiently enough.

It seems I haven't achieved my goal so far, which makes me pretty upset.

I tried to memorise a book of vocabulary, but finally forgot most of the words.

I finished reading two grammar books, but it turns out that there is a gap between knowing the grammar and mastering it.

I am not trying to say that I made no progress. 

My English has obviously improved compared with two years ago.

I just hope it won't take too long before I reach that certain level.

Anyway, I wish myself and all my friends luck to realise each's goal in the coming year.
